# Compensation-Wizard
Financial application to track and review employee compensation.
App will have 3 Principle Databases :  Employee Data and Compensation, Principles and Employee Performance and Calibration.
Principles will work based on Performance and will be derived for each Employee record.
With Pivoting of Data derived by applying Principles, we can look at Stats.
Finally there will be a proposal derived out of summarising the Payouts over the Base Salary.
Key Indicators to track in Proposal Sheet are % of Increment, % of Promotions and Corrective Adjustments in Compensation and % of Incentive over Base Salary.
Above structure is in MS Excel and needs to be converted into a Web App usable by Small and Medium Enterprises.
